# NumPy Essential Training: 1 Foundations of NumPy
NumPy provides Python with an elegant syntax and powerful array processing library. NumPy is the most useful and most powerful library in Python when it comes to data science and machine learning. In this course, Terezija Semenski introduces the NumPy data structure for n-dimensional arrays, then continues by showing functions for creating and manipulating arrays, including indexing and slicing for extracting elements from arrays. She also details how to find unique elements and reverse an array, and describes functions and operators for performing computations with ndarray objects and functions for math and statistics.
